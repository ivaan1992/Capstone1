<b><h3>MOBILE VERSION</h3></b> 

To my capstone mobile version from this template I followed these steps: 

- Made the header which includes the hamburguer icon menu and added some medias. 

- Made the headline section which includes a description of the event, and added a picture.  

- Made the program section which includes the some cards that show us everything there is in the event. 

- Finally made the speakers section which includes random people, but some of them are envolved in the event. I made this section with dynamic HTML 

- After that, I made the about web page.  

<b>This is the Mobile Version</b> 📱
